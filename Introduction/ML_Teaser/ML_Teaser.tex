\subsection{Similarites of problems}
\begin{frame}{Similarity between Data Compression and Machine Learning (ML)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many problems and methods of data compression and machine-learning are similar. Often, only terminology is different.
\item Compression problems can be formulated as e.g. classification, clustering or regression problems $\rightarrow$ ML problems.

\end{figure}
\item Example: A typical image or video compression scheme partitions an image. 
Then, to each part, a collection of syntax elements is assigned and coded. Each syntax 
element can be interpreted as a class label $\mathbf{\rightarrow}$ Compression problem can be regarded as a collection of classification problems. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Probabilistic framework}
\begin{frame}{Probabilstic framework both in ML and data compression}
\bit
\item Typical framework for many ML problems and for many compression problems is probabilistic.
\item Example: Prediction problems. 
\bit 
\item Machine learning problem: 
\bit
\item Given an observed variable $x$ , for a target variable $t$,  find a model for the conditional probabilty $p(t|x)$.
\item Finding a deterministic function, $t=f(x)$ is typically unrealistic for sufficiently complex problems.  
\eit
\item  Similar situation in compression:
\bit
\item Given already decoded information, in principle, any value for the current information is transmittable. 
\item However: Not every value is equally likely. This is exploited in entropy coding and in predictive coding. 
\eit
\eit
\item True probability distribution of the source is usually not known both in ML and compression problems.  
\item Rather: Either make some assumptions to study some model cases or work with empirical distributions, obtained from large data sets.

\begin{itemize}
\item Consider a dataset that consists of a large collection of handwritten digits of the number $3$, taken from MNIST dataset.
\item Each data-sample of a handwritten digit is a grey-scale image with $28\times 28$ pixels. 
\item Thus: Data samples correspond to vectors $x_d\in \mathbb {R}^N$ for $N=784$.

\item Will be shown: DCT-II can be seen as a signal-independent approximation of PCA.
